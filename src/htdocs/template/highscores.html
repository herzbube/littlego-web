    <p>Notes on the ranking algorithm:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The top player is the one with the largest number of games won.</li>
        <li>If two players have the same number of games won, then the player with less games lost has the higher rank.</li>
        <li>If two players have the same number of games won and lost, the player who won more recently has the higher rank.</li>
        <li>In the unlikely case that two players have the same values for all of the above criteria, highscores are sorted alphabetically by player name.</li>
    </ol>
