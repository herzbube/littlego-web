## Introduction

The [original Little Go](https://https://github.com/herzbube/littlego) is a free and open source iOS application that lets you play the game of Go on the iPhone or iPad. This project attempts to reimagine the original iOS app into the world of web applications, so that you can enjoy playing Go in a web browser in real time against a human opponent.

Little Go for the Web is released under the [Apache License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) (2.0).

## Is this useful for me?

If you != me, then the answer is: Probably not â˜º. Little Go for the web is an educational project that I use to learn the basics of server-side and client-side web programming.

If you are interested in playing the game of Go, then frankly you are better of with one of the many established services that are already out there. To get an overview you can check out the 
American Go Association's page [Go on the Internet](http://www.usgo.org/go-internet).
 
I also recommend that you pay a visit to [Sensei's Library](https://senseis.xmp.net/), an invaluable resource for Go in general.
